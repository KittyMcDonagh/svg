    <h1>Data Visualisation</h1>

    <h2>D3 and Scalable Vector Graphics</h2>

    <div id="draw-here"></div>
    <!-- given id "draw here" so d3 can attach to it -->

    <!--    the "data" below will be provided to the svgs. 
            the d3.select, selects the div with id "draw-here" 
            d3 allows you to chain functions together, separated by a . (.select, .append, etc) 
            The ".append("svg)" is programatically creating an svg element, and a width and height 
            of the viewport are being assigned to it (var w & var h; attr(width, w; attr height, h)
            "var svg" results in the creation of an object (svg can be any name) 
            The svg object is used to call the "selectAll" function.
            The selectAll function will select as many circles as are generated as a result of the "data" array.
            The data array is passed as a variable to the ".data" function.
            The d3.enter function binds the data to the circles we're about to create. 
            We're going to create a circle for each entry in the array. 
            An anonymous function is created with 2 variables (d (data - 40, 50, etc), i(index within the array).
            That will give us the x co-ordinate for each datum, for each circle.
            The x value of each datum (circle) is set to be 150 units to the right of its predecessor.
            The y coordinate splits the height of the viewport in 2.
            So the elements combine to be 500 pixels apart and the radius for each is defined in the array.
            If you add another element to this array you wont be able to see it unless you increase the width -->

    <script>
        var w = 700;
        var h = 200;

        var data = [40, 50, 10, 30, 20, 70];

        //Create SVG element
        var svg = d3.select("#draw-here")
            .append("svg")
            .attr("width", w)
            .attr("height", h);
        svg.selectAll("circle")
            .data(data)
            .enter()
            .append("circle")
            .attr("cx", function(d, i) {
                return 50 + (i * 100);
            })
            .attr("cy", h / 2)
            .attr("r", function(d) {
                return d;
            });
    </script>
